    <h3>What is Terranaut?</h3>
    <p>Terranaut connects folks looking for adventure sports gear with folks who have it.  Going snowboarding for a weekend this winter, but don't want to buy a snowboard?  Rent one from a fellow terranaut.  Bought a kayak last summer that you aren't getting as much use out of as you would like?  Rent it out to a fellow terranaut for an amount that seems reasonable to you.</p>
    <h3>Why should I trust other people on Terranaut?</h3>
    <p>Because you're able to rate your fellow Terranauts, they have no incentive to trick you.  If they do, you'll rate them poorly.  Maybe more importantly, however, Terranaut is a community, and terranauts depend on each other.  If you rent out solid quality goods to your compadres, and take solid care of the goods your compadres rent to you, they'll do the same.  Simple as that.</p>
